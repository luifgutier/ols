[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

This API supports the following HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

This API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a resource will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]


[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

This API uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found benath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not created URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
from resource to resource.

[[overview-pagination]]
== Listing resources

Requests that return multiple resources will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can change number of items
returned using the `size` parameter up to a maximum of 500 for a single request. The API also supports the `page`
parameter for accessing a specific page of items.

=== Paging resources

Links will be provided in the response to navigate the resources.

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/page-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

[[resources-api]]
== API
The api endpoint provides the entry point into the service.


[[resources-api-access]]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/api-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-ontologies]]
== Ontologies

The Ontologies resources is used to list ontologies in OLS

[[resources-ontologies-list]]
=== Listing ontologies

A `GET` request will list all of the OLS ontologies.

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/ontologies-list-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

The response is <<overview-pagination,paginated>> where the individual <<resources-ontology,ontology resources>>  are in the `_embedded.ontologies` field.

[[resources-ontology]]

include::{snippets}/ontologies-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-ontology-links]]
==== Links

include::{snippets}/ontologies-example/links.adoc[]

[[resources-ontology-roots]]
==== Roots terms

You can access the root terms or properties in an ontology hierarchy with the following

include::{snippets}/roots-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

[[resources-terms]]
== Terms

The terms resources is used to list terms (or classes) in OLS from a particular ontology

[[resources-terms-list]]
=== Listing ontology terms

include::{snippets}/terms-list-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Optional parameters

|===
|Parameter|Description

|iri
|Filter by IRI, when using IRI the result will always be one

|short_form
|Filter by IRI shortform, these values aren't guaranteed to be unique e.g. GO_0098743


|obo_id
|Filter by OBO id. This is OBO style id that aren't guaranteed to be unique within a given ontology  e.g. GO:0098743

|===

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/terms-list-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

The response is <<overview-pagination,paginated>> where the individual <<resources-term,term resources>>  are in the `_embedded.terms` field.

[[resources-term]]
== Term

=== Retrieve an term

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/terms-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/terms-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/terms-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-terms-links]]
==== Links

include::{snippets}/terms-example/links.adoc[]

==== Related terms

In cases where a term has a direct relation to another term (single existential to a named class in OBO), for example a "part of" relation, the related
terms can be accessed directly with this API.

----
GET /api/ontologies/{ontology_id}/terms/{term_iri}/{property_iri}
----

[[resources-properties]]
== Properties and individuals

You can access property (relationships) and ontology individuals (instances) following similar methods to terms.

=== Retrieve an property

include::{snippets}/properties-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

=== Retrieve an individual

include::{snippets}/individuals-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

[[search]]
= Search

== Search terms

The search API is independent of the REST API and supports free text search over the ontologies. The default search is across all textual fields in the ontology, but results are ranked towards hits in labels, then synonyms, then definitions, then annotations.

----
GET /api/search?q={query}
----

=== Search parameters

|===
|Parameter|Description

|query
|The terms to search. By default the search is performed over term labels, synonyms, descriptions, identifiers and annotation properties.

|===

You can override the fields that are searched by supplying a `queryFields` argument. For example, to query on labels and synonyms use

----
GET /api/search?q={query}&queryFields={label,synonym}
----

|===
|Parameter|Description

|ontology
|Restrict a search to a set of ontologies e.g. `ontology=uberon,ma`

|type
|Restrict a search to an entity type, one of {class,property,individual,ontology}

|slim
|Restrict a search to an particular set of slims by name

|fieldList
|Specifcy the fields to return, the defaults are {iri,label,short_form,obo_id,ontology_name,ontology_prefix,description,type}

|queryFields
|Specifcy the fields to query, the defaults are {label, synonym, description, short_form, obo_id, annotations, logical_description, iri}

|exact
|Set to true for exact matches

|groupField
|Set to true to group results by unique id (IRI)

|obsoletes
|Set to true to include obsoleted terms in the results

|local
|Set to true to only return terms that are in a defining ontology e.g. Only return matches to gene ontology terms in the gene ontology, and exclude ontologies where those terms are also referenced

|childrenOf
|You can restrict a search to children of a given term. Supply a list of IRI for the terms that you want to search under

|allChildrenOf
|You can restrict a search to all children of a given term. Supply a list of IRI for the terms that you want to search under  (subclassOf/is-a plus any hierarchical/transitive properties like 'part of' or 'develops from')

|rows
|How many results per page

|start
|The results page number

|===

== Select terms

We provide an additional search endopint that is designed specifically for selecting ontology terms. This has been tuned specifically to support
applications such as autocomplete.

----
GET /api/select?q={query}
----

|===
|Parameter|Description

|ontology
|Restrict a search to a set of ontologies e.g. `ontology=uberon,ma`

|type
|Restrict a search to an entity type, one of {class,property,individual,ontology}

|slim
|Restrict a search to an particular set of slims by name

|fieldList
|Specify the fields to return, the defaults are {iri,label,short_form,obo_id,ontology_name,ontology_prefix,description,type}

|obsoletes
|Set to true to include obsoleted terms in the results

|local
|Set to true to only return terms that are in a defining ontology e.g. Only return matches to gene ontology terms in the gene ontology, and exclude ontologies where those terms are also referenced

|childrenOf
|You can restrict a search to all children of a given term. Supply a list of IRI for the terms that you want to search under (subclassOf/is-a relation only)

|allChildrenOf
|You can restrict a search to all children of a given term. Supply a list of IRI for the terms that you want to search under  (subclassOf/is-a plus any hierarchical/transitive properties like 'part of' or 'develops from')

|rows
|How many results per page

|start
|The results page number

|===

== Suggest term

We also provide a generic suggester endpoint. This endpoint aims to provide traditional autosuggest based on all the vocabulary in OLS (all class labels or synonyms). All results from this endpoint are unique and are not coupled to any particular ontology, however, searches can be restricted by ontology.

----
GET /api/suggest?q={query}
----

|===
|Parameter|Description

|ontology
|Restrict a search to a set of ontologies e.g. `ontology=uberon,ma`

|rows
|How many results per page

|start
|The results page number
